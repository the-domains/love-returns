**Love Returns utilizes repurposed vintage and deadstock fabric, new sustainable fabric, and craft processes such as hand-dyeing and screen-printing to create truly one-of-a-kind and limited edition pieces. We value sustainability and ethical local production, and our design ethos embodies those principles in everything we make. Love Returns breathes new life into forgotten items of adornment, and the stories of previous owners are respected and transferred into new objects ready to be loved and begin again.**
